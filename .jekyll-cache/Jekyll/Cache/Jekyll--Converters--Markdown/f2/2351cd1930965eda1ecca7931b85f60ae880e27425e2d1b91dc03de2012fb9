I"Õ<p>After learned variational inference and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), I wrote a paper about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03639">Gaussian relational topic model</a> to solve the problem of connection discovery using shared images. In order to continue solving more challenging problems and improving myself, I find it necessary to master Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Therefore, I put my hands on Gibbs sampling and Metropolis Hastings algorithm.</p>
